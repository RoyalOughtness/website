## Features

<CardGrid stagger>
	<Card title="Easy configuration" icon="pencil">
		The build process can be configured entirely in a straightforward YAML format or web UI (coming soon).
	</Card>
	<Card title="Totally extensible" icon="add-document">
		The modular build system can easily be extended by just writing a shell script.
    Modules you create can be added into the official BlueBuild repositories or distributed individually.
	</Card>
	<Card title="Based on standards" icon="puzzle">
		The format of your OS images is the familiar OCI image format, famously used by Docker and Podman.
    With Fedora's Native Container support, it becomes possible to boot natively into a compatible OCI image.
	</Card>
	<Card title="Free and open source" icon="open-book">
		BlueBuild is an open source project built by the community for the community.
    Feel free to peek at and tinker with the source code!
    GitHub also provides CI/CD and a container registry for free, though other providers are supported as well.
