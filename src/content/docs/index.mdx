    We're the new home of the old custom image tooling from Universal Blue.
    This website is very new and a lot of content is missing.

## Features

<CardGrid stagger>
	<Card title="Easy configuration" icon="pencil">
		The build process can be configured entirely in a straightforward YAML format or web UI (coming soon).
	</Card>
	<Card title="Totally extensible" icon="add-document">
		The modular build system can easily be extended by just writing a shell script.
    Modules you create can be added into the official BlueBuild repositories or distributed individually.
	</Card>
	<Card title="Based on standards" icon="puzzle">
		The format of your OS images is the familiar OCI image format, famously used by Docker and Podman.
    With Fedora's Native Container support, it becomes possible to boot natively into a compatible OCI image.
	</Card>
	<Card title="Free and open source" icon="open-book">
		BlueBuild is an open source project built by the community for the community.
    Feel free to peek at and tinker with the source code!
    GitHub also provides CI/CD and a container registry for free, though other providers are supported as well.
	</Card>
  <Card title="Effortless stability" icon="information">
		With your custom images based on stable atomic distributions, your setup will be rock solid.
    As all errors related to customizing your environment happen during the build process in the cloud, it's way harder to end up with a bricked system.
