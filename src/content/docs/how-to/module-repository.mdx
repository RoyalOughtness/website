If you want to [create custom modules](/how-to/making-modules/) for public consumption, you should set up a custom module repository. This is also useful when contributing to the official module repository.

A module repository is a small OCI image where the root path `/modules/` contains each module as a subdirectory with the necessary files inside the subdirectory.

## Setting up the repository

1. Fork [blue-build/modules](https://github.com/blue-build/modules/).
    - This enables you to contribute back to the official repository easily, and get up and running with the proper workflows quickly.
2. Set up container signing with help of the [signing guide](/how-to/cosign/).
3. Enable GitHub Actions from the Actions tab of the repository.
    - These actions will build the OCI image and push it to `ghcr.io/<username>/modules`. The name of the resulting OCI image can be changed in the `.github/build.yml`.

## Making modules

Instructions for making modules are in the [separate guide](/how-to/making-modules/). Public modules should additionally have a `README.md` and [`module.yml`](reference/module/#moduleyml). Modules meant to be contributed back upstream should follow the style guidelines in the modules repo's README.

## Using your custom modules

Modules from custom module repositories can be used by specifying the [`source:`](/reference/module/#source-optional). For example:

```yml {5}
# recipe.yml
modules:
    - type: <name-of-your-module>
      # supports using tags like `:latest` too
      source: ghcr.io/octocat/bluebuild-modules
      list:
          - gec
          - gec
          - gec
```
